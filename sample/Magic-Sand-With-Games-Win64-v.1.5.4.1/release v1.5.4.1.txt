# Release v1.5.4.1 of the Magic-Sand with games. 

Based on the source in the branch called "Magic-Sand-with-Games"

**Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7**
You need to download
- the [Visual C++ run-time components ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145),
- the Free USB Driver tool: [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) and
- the Magic Sand software it-self 

**Mac OS X**
We are working on a Mac OS X build

# Quick start

Download and unzip the files wherever you want.

## Windows
1. Update your video drivers.
2. Install the Visual C++ run-time components (in particular the x86 component even if you run on a 64bits Windows).
3. Install the kinect drivers with the Free USB Driver tool Zadig:
   Select your Xbox Camera, Xbox Audio and Xbox Motor in the drop down and then select the libusb-win32( v1.2.6.0) driver from the driver menu (click on the up/down arrows) and click install.
   You need to do this operation **two to three times**: once for the camera, once for motor and once for the audio.
   See the [freenect github](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect#windows) and [ofxKinect github](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/addons/ofxKinect#windows) for more informations.
   If there is a problem with the detection of the kinect, you can install the [Kinect V1 (SDK 1.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28782) and run again Zadig.

## Setting up the system

Connect and turn on the projector and the kinect and start the Magic-Sand software.

By default the software starts in a **setup** mode where the depth or color image from the Kinect can be seen in the user interface and the projector projects a completely white image. This way it is easy to check if the Kinect is running (on Windows 10 machines it can be necessary to plug and unplug the Kinect several times before it starts) and if the projector is working. The status of the kinect and the projector can be seen in the status window to the lower left in the user interface.

In **setup** mode the physical positions of the Kinect and projector can be optimised. 

### Calibration

To calibrate the system so the kinect and the projector is in correspondence a few steps are needed:
- Flatten the sand in the sand box.
- Make sure that you see either the depth image or the color image from the Kinect (click **advanced|Display Kinect Depth View**)
- Press **Calibration|Manually Draw Sand Region** 
- Define the sand region by drawing a rectangle with the mouse on the Kinect Depth or Color view
- Press **Automatically Calibrate Kinect & Projector** - a series of Chessboard patterns are now projected  on the sand.
- When a prompt appears cover the sand box with a light piece of cardboard or similar
- Press ok -  a series of Chessboard patterns are now projected on the cardboard/plate.

If the calibration is succesful the status window should be updated showing that all is ok.

#### Debug mode for calibration
If the calibration was not succesful a debug mode can be enabled that will place debug files in the **data\DebugFiles** folder. These might point you in the direction of why the calibration failed. Do this by enabling **advanced|Dump Debug** and run the calibration routine again.

**Tips for a nice calibration:**
- Turn off the light in the room for the calibration, depending on the lighting, it may take several tries to get it to complete the calibration sometimes. 
- Make sure you have a perfectly flat cover for the second part of the calibration. If its not flat, it may not calibrate properly. Also, make sure the cover has a matte surface otherwise the kinect may have problem to detect the depth.

## Starting the Application
If the calibration was succesful or if a calibration was done before, the application can be started by pressing space or pushing the **Run** button.

Now a colored map with iso-lines should appear on the sand. The framerate should be close to 60 FPS for modern PCs.
