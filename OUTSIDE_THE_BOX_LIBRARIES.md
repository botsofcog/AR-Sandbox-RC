```javascript

// Use Tone.js to create musical feedback for terrain modification
const terrainSynth = new Tone.PolySynth().toDestination();

function onTerrainChange(elevation, x, y) {
    // Convert elevation to musical note
    const note = Tone.Frequency(200 + elevation * 10, "hz").toNote();
    terrainSynth.triggerAttackRelease(note, "8n");

    // Create spatial audio based on position
    const panner = new Tone.Panner3D(x, 0, y).toDestination();
    terrainSynth.connect(panner);
}

```

```javascript

// Use L-systems to generate organic road networks
class BiologicalRoadGenerator {
    constructor() {
        this.rules = {
            'F': 'F[+F]F[-F]F',  // Branch and grow
            '+': '+',             // Turn right
            '-': '-'              // Turn left
        };
    }

    generateRoadNetwork(iterations) {
        let system = 'F';
        for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {

            const a = this.activator[i];
            const b = this.inhibitor[i];

            // Reaction-diffusion math creates organic growth patterns
            this.activator[i] = a + (a*a/b - a + this.diffusion(i, this.activator));
