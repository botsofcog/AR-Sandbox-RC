## ENHANCED PHYSICS SYSTEM

### Advanced Material Properties

Based on Powder Toy and Noita mechanics, implemented using existing `frontend/js/physics_engine.js`:

- **Vehicle Fleet System** (`frontend/js/vehicle_fleet.js` - 779 lines)

- **Material Systems** (`js/materials/AdvancedTerrainMaterials.js` - 592 lines)

- **Mission Framework** (`frontend/js/mission_system.js` - 525 lines)

### Enhanced Physics Implementation

Extend existing `PhysicsEngine` class:

```javascript

// Add to physics_engine.js
class EnhancedMaterialSystem extends PhysicsEngine {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.materialCombinations = new Map();
        this.temperatureGrid = new Float32Array(this.gridWidth * this.gridHeight);
        this.chemicalStates = new Map();
        this.initializeCombinations();
    }

    initializeCombinations() {
        // Alchemical combinations
        this.addCombination(['sand', 'water', 'cement'], 'wet_concrete');
        this.addCombination(['iron', 'carbon'], 'steel');
        this.addCombination(['limestone', 'heat'], 'lime');
        // ... more combinations
    }
}

```

### Construction Theme Integration

Enhance existing `ConstructionWorkflows` with modern projects:

```javascript

// Extend ConstructionWorkflows.js
const modernProjects = {
    sustainableBuilding: {
        phases: ['site_analysis', 'green_design', 'renewable_systems'],
        materials: ['recycled_steel', 'bamboo', 'solar_panels'],
        environmentalImpact: -20 // Positive environmental effect
    },
    smartCity: {
        phases: ['digital_infrastructure', 'iot_sensors', 'data_integration'],
        materials: ['fiber_optic', 'sensors', 'computing_units'],
        innovationPoints: 50
    }
};

```

### Physical Scoring Integration

Add to existing telemetry system:

```javascript

// Extend telemetry_server.py
class PhysicalRewardSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ball_dispenser = BallDispenser()
        self.hopper_sensors = HopperSensors()
        self.prize_inventory = PrizeInventory()

    def award_construction_token(self, project_type, efficiency_score):
        ball_color = self.get_ball_color(project_type)
        self.ball_dispenser.release_ball(ball_color)
        self.update_player_score(efficiency_score)

```

This design leverages the existing 100,000+ line AR Sandbox RC codebase while adding the enhanced physics, gamification, and endless engagement features you envision.
