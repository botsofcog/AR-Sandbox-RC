# 8-HOUR AUTONOMOUS AR SANDBOX DEVELOPMENT NOTES

## üéØ CRITICAL USER REQUIREMENTS - DON'T FORGET!

### **WHAT USER LOVED:**

- Working AR sandbox with mouse interaction

- Simple computer map aesthetic with topographic colors

- Museum-quality feel - professional, educational

- Basic terrain generation that responded to input

- Clean, technical visualization style

### **WHAT I BROKE:**

- Blue screen mask covering everything

- Mouse clicking doesn't work

- Visuals are gone

- Terrain not rendering properly

### **USER'S CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS:**

- "make it somehow work with both? combine into a new system?"

- "use all samples and code and project files. github resources"

- "scrape github or use tools like our extensions or plugins"

- "use that shit" (referring to proven samples)

- "i loved what we had" - DON'T SCRAP, FIX AND ENHANCE

- "that museum feel is nice"

- "keep topology and mapping feel with basic colorations"

- "simple computer map" vibe

- "projection onto a box" for display

- "i wave my hand around the webcam to test" - webcam hand detection

### **TESTING METHOD:**

- User waves hand around webcam to test terrain creation

- Hand closer = higher terrain (Magic Sand style)

- Should work in real-time, smooth response

### **VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Simple computer map aesthetic

- Basic topographic colorations

- Museum-quality professional feel

- Projection-friendly visuals

- Clean technical visualization

- Contour lines for elevation

## üìÅ AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO UTILIZE

### **PROVEN SAMPLES:**

- `sample/sandbox-master/WaterTable2.cpp` - Professional Saint-Venant water physics

- `sample/Magic-Sand-master/src/Games/vehicle.cpp` - Working vehicle AI system

- `sample/Magic-Sand-master/src/KinectProjector/` - Kinect integration

- `sample/your_demo/constants.ts` - Working physics constants

- `sample/open_AR_Sandbox-main/` - Python implementation

### **GITHUB RESOURCES FOUND:**

- The Powder Toy (4.8k stars) - Element interaction physics

- UniPowder - Unity ECS powder simulation

- Various falling sand physics implementations

### **INSPIRATION SOURCES:**

- God games (SimCity, Civilization) - terrain manipulation

- Science sims (Kerbal, Universe Sandbox) - parameter controls

- Element mixing games (Little Alchemy, Powder Game) - interactions

- Kinetic AR sandboxes - real-time hand interaction

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED FIRST

1. **Blue screen issue** - Changed background from `#001122` to `#f5f5f5`
2. **Mouse interaction** - Verify editTerrain function works
3. **Terrain rendering** - Ensure terrain actually displays
4. **Webcam hand detection** - Fix updateFromWebcam function

## üéÆ FEATURES TO INTEGRATE

### **From Magic Sand:**

- Vehicle AI with flocking behavior

- Kinect depth sensing

- Professional rendering pipeline

- Game controller systems

### **From Sandbox-Master:**

- Saint-Venant water equations

- GPU-accelerated physics

- Professional fluid dynamics

### **From Powder Toy:**

- Element interaction systems

- Fire/water/steam state changes

- Particle physics simulation

- Temperature and pressure systems

## üö® CRITICAL FAILURE PATTERN - LAST 3 AUTONOMOUS TESTS FAILED:

- **FAILURE PATTERN:** User returns to broken/incomplete work every time

- **SPECIFIC FAILURES:**

  1. Claimed things worked that didn't work
  2. Went off track from user requirements
  3. Rushed through without proper testing

- **USER WARNINGS:**

  - "before was a test that you failed" - Previous autonomous attempts failed
  - "im not visually seeing any of your claims" - Don't claim things work that don't
  - "it hasnt even been an hour though how are you on phase 2" - Don't rush
  - "the last 3 tests of being left alone you failed" - CRITICAL PATTERN

## üéØ THIS TIME MUST BE DIFFERENT:

- **NO CLAIMING** anything works without visual verification

- **STAY ON TRACK** - follow user's exact requirements religiously

- **TEST EVERYTHING** as I build it - open browser and verify

- **QUALITY OVER SPEED** - better fewer working features than many broken

- **DOCUMENT PROGRESS** clearly and honestly

## üö® REAL 8-HOUR SESSION - USER IS ACTUALLY GONE:

**START TIME:** 2:35 PM
**RETURN TIME:** 10:35 PM
**USER STATUS:** FOR FUCKING REAL LEAVING NOW

## üå± ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT APPROACH CONFIRMED:

- **PRESERVE** the working base system user loves (3D blocks, camera, mouse)

- **ORGANICALLY GROW** new features into existing system

- **NO PIPELINE DEV** - natural evolution only

- **GENTLE ENHANCEMENTS** not aggressive rewrites
